# Create Cluster

Cluster with managed nodegroup.

Get vpc_id and subnet ids from step 1 Terraform output.

In real world, TF states will be saved from S3 and fetched from remote state. Or all the steps can be merged in to the same repo.

The current setup is purely for clearer logic demostration purpose.
